Paralegal Toolkit is a browser-based extension designed to streamline common litigation document workflows.

The initial release focuses on **automated Bates stamping** for PDF documents. Future modules will include secure redaction tools and additional document management utilities tailored for paralegals and litigation support professionals.

## Chrome extension — Bates stamping

All processing runs on your computer; no PDF data is sent to any server.

### Build and load

1. From the project root:
   ```bash
   cd extension
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. In Chrome: open `chrome://extensions` → turn on **Developer mode** → **Load unpacked** → choose the **`extension`** folder (the one that contains `manifest.json` and `viewer.html`).

**If you use the `extension/dist` folder** (smaller, for store upload): run `npm run package` from the `extension` folder, then load **`extension/dist`** in Chrome.

**Changes not showing?** After editing code you must:
1. Run **`npm run build`** from the `extension` folder (or `npm run package` if you load from `dist`).
2. In **chrome://extensions**, click the **Reload** button on your extension. Chrome does not auto-reload unpacked extensions.

### How to use

1. Click the extension icon.
2. **Choose PDF file** → select a PDF → **Open viewer**.
3. Set prefix, start number, position, font size, and zero-pad. Your last settings are saved for next time.
4. Use **Apply Bates & download** to generate the stamped PDF.  
   **Keyboard:** ← / → to change pages.

See `extension/README.md` for more detail and the local-only design.

## Why this exists
